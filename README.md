# 🧩 Stone, Paper, Scissors Game (C++)

This project is a **training implementation** of the classic *Stone, Paper, Scissors* game — built purely in **C++** to strengthen programming fundamentals and demonstrate structured problem-solving.

---

## 🧠 Project Purpose  
This project was developed as part of my learning journey in **C++ programming**, focusing on:
- Applying **control structures** and **enums**.  
- Practicing **functions** for modular, reusable code.  
- Using **random number generation** and **loops** effectively.  
- Building a clear, maintainable **program structure**.

It serves as a **practical exercise** to improve logic design and translate core programming concepts into working code.

## ⚙️ Code Architecture  
The program is organized into:
- **`enums`** for quiz levels and operator types.  
- **Independent functions** for input handling, result calculation, and game flow.  
- **Randomized computer choices** using `rand()` and `srand()`.  
- **Loop-based gameplay control** for multiple rounds and score tracking.

This design keeps the logic **modular**, **readable**, and easy to expand for future improvements.
